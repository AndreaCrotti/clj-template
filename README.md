# clj-template

Ever begin to write HTML and feel the urge to gouge out your eyes? Ever realize you have to write XML and get the sudden urge to rip your hair out?

Welcome `clj-template`, your savior.

## Installation

To jump in and get started simply add:

* `[clj-template "0.8.0"]` to your project.clj file
* `(:require [clj-template.html :refer :all])` to your project namespace
  * Note that doing the above will collide with a few default `clojure.core` namespace functions, namely `map` and `meta`. To resolve this you can either namespace the import (i.e. something like `(:require [clj-template.html :as h])`) or reference Clojure map and meta functions as `clojure.core/map` and `clojure.core/meta` respectively.

## Usage

`clj-template` makes it very simple to generate html. Assuming you've loaded `clj-template.html` into your namespace we can start with some very basic examples.

#### Generating a simple webpage

```clojure
(html
  (head (title {:style "font-family:'Courier';"} "My Simple Web Site"))
  (body (p "A paragraph of content.") (br)
        (p "Another paragraph of content")))
```

which will output...

```html
<html>
  <head><title style="font-family:'Courier';">My Simple Web Site</title>
  </head>
  <body><p>A paragraph of content.</p><br></br>
        <p>Another paragraph of content</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, when rendering this you might notice that the pesky `<br></br>` element turns into two separate `<br>` tags. To resolve this, and achieve the intended results, we suffix the function with a dash (i.e. `br-`) which will render an unbalanced node (i.e. `<br />`).

Our modified code then looks like...

```clojure
(html
  (head (title {:style "font-family:'Courier';"} "My Simple Web Site"))
  (body (p "A paragraph of content.") (br-)
        (p "Another paragraph of content")))
```

which renders...

```html
<html>
  <head><title style="font-family:'Courier';">My Simple Web Site</title>
  </head>
  <body><p>A paragraph of content.</p><br />
        <p>Another paragraph of content</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
